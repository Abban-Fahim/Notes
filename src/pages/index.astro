			<h1>Abban's notes</h1>
			<p>This website is a collection of (almost) all of my notes and thoughts about courses I take and things that I am interested in studying.</p>
			<p>Most of them come from my undergraduate courses at Heriot-Watt university, where I'm studying robotics. The rest come from various courses and notes availableonline, which I cite as needed.</p>

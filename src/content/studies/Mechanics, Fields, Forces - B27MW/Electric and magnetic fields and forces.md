##### Coulomb's law

> *The force between two charged particles is proportional to the product of the magnitude of each of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance that separates them.*

$$ F_E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_1Q_2}{r^2} $$

where $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$ equals $8.99 \times 10^9$

This creates an idea of an **electric field**, which is the strength of an electric charge's effect on other nearby charges

$$ E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2} $$

##### Electric potential

For a uniform electric field, the **voltage**, or **potential difference**, is the work done moving a positive charge

$$ V = \frac{W}{q} = Ed = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r} $$

this gives us **electrical potential energy** from $W = Vq$

$$ U = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} $$

if this energy is transferred to a charge, the motion of that charge is

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{qrV}{m}} $$
$$ a = \frac{qE}{m} $$

##### Magnetic field 

A charged particle moving with velocity $v$, at an angle $\theta$ to a magnetic field, experiences a perpendicular force

$$ F_B = Bqv \sin{\theta} $$

the force experienced is always orthogonal to the direction of motion, and the magnetic field. Hence the force does not affect the particle's actual velocity, but only the direction

The path created by this force is of circular motion, with the force being the centripetal force

$$ r = \frac{mv}{qB} $$
$$ T = \frac{2 \pi m}{qB} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ f = \frac{qB}{2 \pi m} $$
##### Electro-magnetic induction

A moving charge can also has a magnetic field around it

$$ B = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{qv \sin{\phi}}{r^2} $$
where $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^-7$

In a current carrying conductor (wire), the expression for magnetic field is

$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} $$

between two parallel wires, the force per unit length can be a sum of the individual effects

$$ \frac{F}{L} = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi r} $$

##### Magnetic flux

> **Faraday's law**: *The magnitude of an induced e.m.f. is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.*

> **Lenz's Law**: *The direction of an induced e.m.f opposes the cause of induction.*

which gives us

$$ \mathrm{e.m.f.} \propto - \frac{d \Phi}{dt} $$
in a **solenoid**, which is a coil of wires with $N$ turns, the magnetic flux is given as

$$ \Phi = BAN $$

**inductance**, $L$, is measured in *Henries* (H)

$$ L = \frac{N\Phi}{I} $$
this relates to induced e.m.f

$$ \mathrm{e.m.f.} = -L \frac{dI}{dT} $$

the energy stored at a given time in an inductors is

$$ U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2 $$

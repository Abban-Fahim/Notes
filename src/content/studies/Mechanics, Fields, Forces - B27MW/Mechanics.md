##### SUVAT

Equations of motion with constant acceleration

$$v = u + at$$
$$s= \frac{1}{2} (u+v) t $$
$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
$$s=vt- \frac{1}{2}at^2 $$
$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

$$a = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\ v = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\ s$$
$$s = \int v \ dt = \int a \ dt $$

### Angular motion

##### Uniform circular motion

A particle or object may moves in angular motion when they have a centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, of constant magnitude towards a centre $R$ m away, and a constant speed, $v$,
$$a_c = \frac{v^2}{R} = \frac{4\pi^2R}{T^2} $$
##### Non-uniform circular motion

If a particle has non-constant speed, the particle has a perpendicular component of acceleration, $a_{tan}$, which is tangential to the circle

$a$ is the resultant of the two accelerations
$$ a = \sqrt{a_{c}^2 + a_{tan}^2 } $$
##### Law of circular motion

$$\sum F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{R} $$

##### Laws of angular motion

- $s$ is the arc/distance moved
- $\theta$ is the angle in radians of the arc moved
- $R$ is the distance in m to the centre of the motion
- $\omega$ is the angular velocity in rad/s
- $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration in rad/s$^2$

$$\theta = \frac{s}{R} $$
$$ \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} $$
$$ \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} $$

- with constant acceleration: 

$$ \omega = \alpha t $$
$$ \theta = \omega t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 $$
$$ \omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta $$

##### Relations with linear motion

$$ v = R\omega $$
$$ a_{tan} = R\alpha $$
$$ a_c = \omega^2 R $$

##### Energy in angular motion

The moment of inertia of masses rotating around a fixed axis is

$$ I_{sys} = \sum (m_iR_i^2) $$

For common bodies

For objects in motion AND rotation

$$ K.E = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

conservation of energy in rolling motion

$$ P_{top} + K_{trans_{top}} + K_{rot_{top}} = P_{bottom} + K_{trans_{bottom}} + K_{rot_{bottom}}$$

##### Torque

$$ \uptau = Fl $$

Where $l$ is the perpendicular distance from axis of rotation

$$ \sum \uptau = I\alpha $$

Work and power from a torque are

$$ W = \uptau \Delta \theta $$
$$ P = \uptau \omega $$

##### Angular momentum

$$ L = I\omega = mRv $$

- in the absence of external torques, angular momentum is conserved. It may be helpful when when a body's inertia changes

$$ I_f\omega_f = I_i\omega_i $$

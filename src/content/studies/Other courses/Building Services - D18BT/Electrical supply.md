## General guidelines for safety

- Do not place Electric Power wires next to other cabled systems (telephone, radio, television, fire alarms, bells, etc). Maintain atleast 50mm between high voltage wires an other cables.
- Fuses are placed in the circuit to prevent excess of current. Switches are placed in the live wire. Any metal casings of appliances should be connected to Earth.
- The electricity supply to washrooms must be limited to 12V, with outlets only to be used for shavers and hairdryers, with breakers connected in case of high conduction.
- Cables must have have mineral insulations around the conductors, and a copper sheath covering that insulation. Smaller cables must use an insulation of PVC or rubber to prevent naked access to conductors. When using conduits to organise large amounts of cables, building codes must be followed (e.g. BS 7671, IEEE) which limit the number and diameter of cables within a specific diameter of conduit.

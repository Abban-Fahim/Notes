## Factor theorem

If a $(ax-b)$ is a factor of a polynomial $P(x)$, then $P(\frac{b}{a})=0$.

## Remainder theorem

Instead of dividing a polynomial entirely, we can use the following equation to calculate the remainder of division by a **linear polynomial**:

$$P(x)=Q(x)(ax-b)+\frac{b}{a}$$

Then the remainder is equal to $\frac{b}{a}$.

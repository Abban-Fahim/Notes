When $n$ is a positive integer, we can expand the following into an n-sized polynomial with expansion:

$$(a+b)^{n}=a^{n}+\binom{n}{1}a^{n-1}b+\binom{n}{2}a^{n-2}b^{2}\dots+b^{n}$$

The value of $\binom{n}{r}$ is equal to $\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, or can be find using Pascal's triangle.

The *general binomial theorem* states that for rational value of $x$, and $|x|<1$

$$(1+x)^{n}=1+nx+\frac{n(n-1)}{2!}x^{2}+\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!}x^{3}\dots$$

This series form an infinite sequence and has many likeliness to the [[Maths/Polynomials & Functions/Taylor Series|Taylor Series]] and [[Maths/Statistics/Discrete random variables|Discrete random variables]]. We can also find a general expression for $(a+x)^{n}$ by factorising $a$ out of the expression:

$$(a+x)^{n}=a^{n}\left(1+\frac{x}{a}\right)^{n}$$

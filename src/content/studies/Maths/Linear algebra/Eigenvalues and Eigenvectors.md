To find the eigenvalue of a square matrix, we can find it using the characteristic polynomial

$$Ax=\lambda x$$

To find the value of eigenvalues, we can rearrange to find a homogeneous equation:

$$(\lambda I - A)x=0$$

Then to calculate the non-trivial (non-zero) values of this $\lambda$, we solve $\det(\lambda I - A) = 0$.

Then we can substitute this $\lambda$ value into the first equation, which will give us the eigenvectors as vector $x$.

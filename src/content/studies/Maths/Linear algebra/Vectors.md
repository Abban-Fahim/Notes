## Dot product

This is the first kind of product of multiplying two vectors, which gives a scalar value as such

$$\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = a_{i}b_{i}+a_{j}b_{j}+a_{k}b_{k} = |a||b|\cos{\theta}$$

Where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. For parallel vectors this angle is 0, giving us just $|a||b|$. For perpendicular vectors it is $\frac{\pi}{2}$, which gives us a dot product of 0.

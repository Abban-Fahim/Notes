Truly the bane of calculus and our sanity. The process of reverse-differentiation is essential for many complex relations and mechanical engineers, as if that will persuade them to attend lectures.

## Integration by substitution

This is thought of as the opposite of the chain-rule of differentiation, and involves using a new variable to change an expression into a more solvable integral.

## Integration by parts

For even worse integrals where two unlikely terms are multiplied together, and the differential of one of them makes it a constant or something that simplifies the expression. The rule states:

$$\int{uv^{\prime}\;dx}=uv-\int{u^{\prime}v\;dx}$$

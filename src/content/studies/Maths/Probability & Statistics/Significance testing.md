The premise of testing a hypothesis with statistical data is based on proving or rejecting a the opposite of a fact that you want to prove. The **null hypothesis**, $H_{0}$ is this opposite, and is what we have to reject or approve. The **alternative hypothesis**, $H_{1}$ is the fact itself and is proved when $H_{0}$ is rejected.

We define a rejection region $R$, usually for a range of values of the random variable, and a significance level $\alpha$, which is the probability of accepting $H_{1}$ when it is true. The rejection region may be a simple PDF or PMF range, or an estimator $\hat{\Theta}_{n}$ which is a function of a critical value $\xi$.

We can bypass the selection of $\alpha$ by using a $p$-value, which just combines the uses of $\alpha$ and $\xi$. We stan

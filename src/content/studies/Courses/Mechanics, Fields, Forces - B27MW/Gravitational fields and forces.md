##### Newton's law of gravity

$$ F_g = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2} $$

Where $G$ is the **universal gravitational constant** = $6.6743 \times 10^{-11}\; \mathrm{Nm^2kg^{-2}}$

**Gravity due to acceleration**, $g$, is the effect of gravity by one object on all other objects in the field

$$ g = \frac{GM}{r^2} $$

**Potential energy** at a point is the *work done* moving a mass from infinity to the point

$$ U = -\frac{GMm}{r} $$

hence the **gravitational** potential energy is

$$ E_p = mgh $$

##### Satellites

A mass assumes a uniform circular orbit around a larger mass when the forces $F_c$ and $F_g$ acting on it are in equilibrium

$$ F_c = F_g $$
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} $$

The speed of a satellite only depends on its distance from the larger mass. This applies to the orbital period too

$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}} $$

##### Keppler's laws

> **First law:** *Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun  at one focus of the ellipse.*

![[imgs/Pasted image 20230801124122.png]]
- where $e$ is *eccentricity*, a value between 0 to 1
- $a$ is the *semi-major axis* length

> **Second law:** *A line from the Sun to a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.*

> **Third law:** *The period of a planetary orbit is proportional to the 3/2 power of the semi-major axis length.*

For the time period of an elepitical orbit, we can replace radius with semi-major axis length, and the third law will still hold true

$$ T \propto a^{3/2} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3}{GM_{\odot}}} $$

##### Black holes

The escape velocity of a planet is the speed required for any mass to reach a potential energy of 0

$$ v_{ESC} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}} = \sqrt{\frac{8G \pi \rho r^2}{3}} $$
where $R$ is the radius of the planet

$$ R_E = 6.38 \times 10^6 \ m $$

When the density of an object becomes so high, that $v_{ESC} \geq c$, even light cannot escape these stars, and it is known as a **black hole**

The Schwarzschild radius gives radius of a black for a given mass

$$ r_S = \frac{2GM}{c^2} $$

##### Einstein's postulates

> **The principal of relativity**: *All laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference*

> **The constancy of the speed of light**: *The speed of light in a vacuum has the same value, ùëê = 2.99792458 √ó 108 m/s, in all inertial reference frames, regardless of the velocity of the observer or the velocity of the source emitting the light.*

##### Proper time

- $\Delta t_0$ is the proper time that is measured by an observer in the frame of reference in which the event occurs. Think, a person inside a rocket.
- $\Delta t$ is the time measured by a secondary, external observer

$$ \Delta t = \gamma \cdot \Delta t_0 $$

- $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, and is always greater than 1

$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$

Hence the effect of **time dilation**, as the observed time of an object in motion is always greater than the proper time experienced by someone in the travelling object. This relativistic effect is only noticeable at speeds greater than 10% the speed of light. 

This effect is also noticeable for length objects, but as **contraction**

$$  l = l_0\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{l_0}{\gamma}  $$

momentum is the same as time

$$ p = \gamma m v $$

this leads to a concept of relativistic mass

$$ m_{rel} = \gamma m $$

##### Relative energy

According to Einstein's famous equation, a particle at rest also has an energy,

$$ E_R = mc^2 $$

- at high speeds, an object also has relativistic energy

$$ E_{rel} = m_{rel}c^2 = \gamma mc^2 $$

- this gives us a new definition for *kinetic energy*, that is more accurate than Newton's definition

$$ K = E_{rel} - E_R $$
$$ K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 $$

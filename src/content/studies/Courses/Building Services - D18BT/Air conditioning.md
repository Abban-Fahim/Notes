Air conditioning (A/C) refers to the constant maintenance of a thermally comfortable environment for occupants, by either lowering air temperatures or adding heat to the surroundings. There are three types of A/C systems:

- Unitary systems, for direct installation and usage in single room/apartment settings
- All air systems, for use in settings with large volumes of air and need for cooling like auditoriumsÂ 
- Air-Water systems, for small scale applications of cooling with all the processes taking place together

Further there is also the difference between ***Comfort*** and ***Industrial A/C***, where comfort cooling requires only maintaining 'internal dry-bulb temprature' while humidity can vary (20%-60% is what humans are adopted to live in), whereas industrial cooling is applied in manufacturing, healthcare and pharmaceuticals

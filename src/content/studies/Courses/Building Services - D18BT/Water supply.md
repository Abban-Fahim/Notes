# Things to consider when constructing water supply systems

- Water must not remain stagnant for too long. Avoid dead-ends and prefer loops that enable constant flow of water
- Cold water storage should be placed up high. Can be placed indoors but they reduce the overhead space available
- Main supply pipes are usually built 750mm below the ground
- Particular care must be taken with the choice of materials as well as positioning of pipework outside dwellings due to affects of weathering and freezing
- Sanitary appliances (Baths, LB, WC, etc) should not receive water straight from the main piping
- Hot water storage and heater must be be stored in an airing cupboard and lagged (insulated)
- Special delivery pipes must be routed to sanitary appliances, with a pair of hot and cold going to each appliance
- Pipework designs should follow a tree-branch pattern, with a central vertical pipe from the cistern of

# Water Pipe Design Guidelines

1.  First we get an accurate layout of and requirements of our dwelling
    - The appliances used by each room/accommodation, and figure out their due
    - The standard minimum storage requirements for your building/occupation
    - Add 20% of volume consideration for ballcock.
    - Now draw up a diagram of the pipework
1.  Calculate the total DU (Discharge Units) according to the given plan by adding up the DUs of individual appliances. Note that as the main piping goes up floors, its total DU requirement increases by adding up the floors own capacity and of the floors below it.Â 
2.  Use a formal datasheet/manual (e.g. BS EN 806) to chose a material of piping and corresponding pipe sizes and diameters, enough to accommodate the DU at each floor location. Always go higher instead of lower than the calculated DU in order to ensure safety, but not too high as it can damage appliances by providing too much pressure. You can combine pipes of the same material but different sizes and diameters to create an appropriate design.

Discuss all possible noise sources that can affect a classroom in a large city school, and explain how the noise disturbances can be reduced.

- Noises from the building services like air conditioning, air ventilation, and generators. The external sources of noise could be vehicles running outside, and any local or school construction work. To reduce the internal noise we can improve the sound absorption 

Explain how sound is absorbed by a layer of porous material attached to a wall and what physical properties can affect sound absorption.

- Sound energy from the waves is transferred into heat that is dissipated, and mechanical energy that is conducted, by the material when a sound wave reaches the interface of the material. More dense materials absorb less sound,  while thicker insulations and more porous materials absorb more sound.

Define reverberation time and provide the equation for determining its value.

The optimum reverberation time for a lecture theatre is between 0.4 – 1.0 second. If the reverberation time falls out with this range, discuss how this will affect speech intelligibility in a lecture theatre and provide possible solutions that can be used to modify it.

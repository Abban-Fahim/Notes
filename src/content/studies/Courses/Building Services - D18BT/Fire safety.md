The main elements that determine fires inside buildings are: **heat**, **oxygen**, and **fuel**. Heat is the component that causes the ignition, and can be any source of just high temperatures like heated metal surfaces, naked flames, electric sparks or friction. Oxygen is a normal part of air in buildings, and is required for the chemical process of combustion to keep taking place. Fuel can be a variety of things and the fuel in a particular place is dependant on the situation itself. Most common fuels are wooden building materials and furniture, fabric items, flammable liquids and chemicals like oils, paints, and cleaning materials.


## Fire risk classification

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| A   | Fires involving solid materials |
| B   | Fires involving flammable liquids |
| C   | Fires involving flammable gasses |
| D   | Fires involving flammable metals |
| F   | Fires involving cooking oils |

Smoke released from fires is more often the cause of deaths in humans, as it contains harmful gases and creates breathing difficulties. Other risks associated with fires is injury, property damage, and disruption of operations.

## Protective Systems

- **Detection systems**, usually paired with alarms, used to alert occupants of fires in their building, usually using either temprature sensors or smoke detectors.
- **Portable extinguishers** are placed in many accessible locations in a building and are used to deal fires at early stages. They can be of different types and are colour coded to show that: *Water extinguishers* (red band) can only deal with class A fires, with some additives even class Bs; *Foam extinguishers* (cream band) can deal with classes A and B; *Powder extinguishers* (blue band) can be used on most classes of fire as well as on electrical components; *CO2 extinguishers* (black band) can also be used to deal with any fire but specially with electric fires; *fire blankets* are used to put fires out by removing the air supply to the source.
- **Hose and reel sprinklers** are placed in locations to aid firefighters and are connected to mains water supplies, and work by shooting out jets of water at high pressures. **Sprinklers** cause lass damage to furniture and walls and are usually automatically activated by the fire detection system.
- Protecting building elements can also reduce the severity of fires by not allowing it to spread further, by for example using metal structures and flame-retardant paint on wooden materials.
- **Smoke control systems** are used to minimise the harm to health caused by smoke particulates and increase visibility in corridors and stairwells to ensure people can safely evacuate. These include: smoke reservoirs to collect smoke away from the breathing zones for humans; ventilation and windows and exhaust fans to remove smoke from the interior as fast as possible.

## Evacuation planning

Escape routes must be designed effectively to ensure that most occupants can exit the building in reasonable time and can accommodate enough flow of people. The escape routes must be protected from fires and must have guiding signs to allow people to find them easily, including emergency lighting systems and luminous signage. Consideration must be also given for people with impairments by making all escape procedures accessible, and for creating temporary indoor refugee rooms for temporary safety, and external staircases to ensure escape routes are not clogged up.

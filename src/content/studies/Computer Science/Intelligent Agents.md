An agent is defined as an abstract entity that observes the environment using sensors, and acts upon it using actuators. They maybe classified as "intelligent" if they exhibit such behaviour.

## Search problems

For a goal-based agent to achieve its goal, it may invoke searches to find a sequence of actions to achieve its goal. The requirements for this is a state space, a model for actions and successor functions, a start state and goal state measure/state.

One way to model the state space is using a tree, where nodes represent state, with the root node being the start state, with the successor functions being edges.

##### First law of thermodynamics

$$W+Q=\Delta U$$
$$\Sigma Q + \Sigma W = 0$$
- $Q$ = Heat transferred
- W = Work done
- Work done by the system or removed from the system is *-ve*
- Work done on the system or added to the system is *+ve*

**$$\Delta U = mc\Delta T $$

##### Ideal gases

$\frac{pV}{T}$ is a constant for a 'perfect gas'

$$pV = n\tilde{R}T$$

where $\tilde{R}$ = 8.314 $\frac{J}{kmole\,K}$

$$pV = mRT$$

##### Pressure-Volume relationships

$$p_1 V_1^n = p_2 V_2^n = k$$

Work done by a polytropic process:

$$W=\frac{p_1V_1 - p_2V_2}{1-n}$$

or when n = 1

$$W=mRT\ln{\frac{V_1}{V_2}}$$

To calculate n

$$n = \log_{\frac{V_1}{V_2}}{\frac{P_2}{P_1}} $$
